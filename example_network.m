#read the following comments, fill the following template, open a terminal, launch octave, past this command and press Enter: run("~/kali-sim/example_network.m")

#if plotting with gnuplot goes wrong, or if you do not have gnuplot, replace the argument of the graphics_toolkit function at line 33 by "fltk"

#kmax: the number of iterations performed during a run

#repeat: the number of times the run is repeated

#edge_label: the edge names

#node_label: the node names

#plot_label: the node names for the plot legends, for example if a node is named "DNA_damage" it should be renamed "DNA damage" for the plot legends

#node0: the node initial states, selected randomly by the algorithm along a uniform distribution in an appropriate interval of [0;1]

#p: for each edges, the portion of its value which is updated at each iteration, low for slow responsive edges, high for fast responsive edges, selected randomly by the algorithm along a uniform distribution in an appropriate interval of [0;1]

#q: for each edges, the weakening of its value applied at each iteration, low for weak edges, high for strong edges, selected randomly by the algorithm along a uniform distribution in an appropriate interval of [0;1]

#f_edge: the function which update edge values at each iterations, for shorter computation time, comment or delete the first four lines and replace <node name> by node(<i>,k), also comment or delete line 35

#f_node: the function which update node values at each iterations, for shorter computation time, comment or delete the first four lines and replace <edge name> by edge(<i>,k), also comment or delete line 35

#the example network is an implementation of a logical graph used by Melody K Morris et al: Melody K Morris, Julio Saez-Rodriguez, Peter K Sorger, and Douglas A Lauffenburger. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry, 49(15):3216â€“3224, 2010.
